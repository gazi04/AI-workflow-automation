> The goal of this project is to automate workflows through a simple chatGPT like prompt or even through talking

## How does it work
The project is build on layers there is the AI layer that takes the request of the user and converts it into a template like for the computer to read it so in the end that means the AI doesn't write the code for the automation that the user wants but it creates a template what he wants we feed this to the orchestration and the orchestration layer will based on the receipt will create the automation from the available code.
